        Hey, I am
    </b>
  <b class="name">Amber.</b>
  <b>
    I am a
  </b>
  <b class="hobby">front-end developer,</b>
  <b>
     and I do multiple types of stuff. For web, I use
  </b>
  <b class="language">HTML5</b>
  <b>and</b>
  <b class="language">CSS.></b>
  <b> I do</b>
  <b class="language">JavaScript</b>
  <b>sometimes. For programs, I use</b>
  <b class="language">C#</b>
  <b>and</b>
  <b class="language">Python.</b>
  <b>I like to toy around with stuff and make my own things that can be similar to things I like but enhanced to my desire. I like cats quite a bit and I like to talk about them. I also am a gamer. I play Gorilla Tag, Beat Saber, EchoVR, Terraria, Roblox, Minecraft, and more! If you ever want anything, you can join my discord. I will add some buttons for invites to my El Gato and Personal server. Just type it in chat, and I will probably see it. If chat is a bit crowded, or if it is an emergency, than shoot me a DM. I don't program for free to randos. Don't harass me or my friends, or do mean stuff. I just try to vibe and if I don't like you, nothing personal, but I will try to keep you away from me. I am an intermediate, or decent, developer. I do a lot of my stuff from tutorials, too. If you ever need anything, I would be happy to help. I am fine for helping you with programming, but it isn't ergent to me. </b>

  <h2>Cat Memes </h2>
  <p>As you can tell, I love cat memes. I have a whole section of my site for it. I love cats because they simply look cute to me. Also, modern day cat memes fit my sense of humor. IP memes, "mentally insane" memes, and just random stuff. Now, come to my favorite cat memes. I like Leroy, Big Foot Jinx, and obviously, El Gato. I found out about El Gato because I like Origami and Papercraft. I was scrolling on (god forbid me) TikTok, and found the sweet little boi named El Gato (cat in spanish). It was with a (again, god forbid me) Demon Slayer audio. I knew it said Arigato (thank you in japanese), but everyone was acting as if it said El Gato. And I died laughing. Not only because how cute it was, but it's kinda random. </p>
